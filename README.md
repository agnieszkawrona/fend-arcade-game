###### HOW TO PLAY?
- clone this repository
- run index.html

###### FUNCTIONALITY
- You're controlling moves of the player (the little guy at the bottom of the board). You can move up, down, left or right using arrows on your keyboard.
- You're supposed to not collide with the Bugs, otherwise, you lose and the game starts over.
- When you reach the water at the top of the board, you win, you get the congrats and the game start over so you can go again :)
